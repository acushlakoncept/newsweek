# Newsweek

In this project, Twitter‚Äôs Bootstrap framework was used to clone the [NewsWeek.com](https://www.newsweek.com/) website.

> In the course of working in this project, the following concepts were mastered

- Bootstrap v4.0 Grid Layout
- Flex order class
- Some CSS Advanced Selectors
- Bootstrap classes that change base on screen sizes. (`col-sm`, `col-md`, `col-lg`, and `col-xl`)
- Got a deeper look into the bootstrap v4 documentation.

> I learned a lot in the course of building this project.

> The mobile-first-approach was taken to tackle the design.
